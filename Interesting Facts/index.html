            <h2 class="head">1) Genghis Khan started from humble beginnings.</h2>
            <p class="details">
                Genghis Khan was born in 1162 in Mongolia. His original name was Temujin that means 'blacksmith'. His people lived in the 
                grasslands, and were illiterate. They were herdsmen, hunter gatherers, and expert horsemen. Though his father was head of his 
                tribe, he was initially rejected even as a tribal leader.

                The Western Xia and Jin empires occupied much of the area north of the Yangtze River, and over the 19-year period of his rule 
                as the Khan (1208–1227), he initiated campaigns that almost totally eradicated the Western Xia. With only 50,000 troops, they 
                attacked the Jin who had 500,000 troops and occupied most of the Jin Empire.
                <br><br>
                He began the huge Yuan Empire that was ruled by his children and grandchildren. Genghis Khan died while fighting the last 
                Western Xia troops.

                stretched from Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea. His personal empire was more than 2 times bigger than the approximately 6,000,000 km² Greek 
                Empire of Alexander the Great.

            <p class="details">
                Figures vary, but about <strong>20 to 40 million people</strong> or from 5 to 10 percent of the world population were killed or 
                died because of his attacks. Famine and disease killed a large portion of the people. He eradicated many cities and countries

            <p class="details">
                One of the methods he used to build up his army and acquire territory was by being lenient with enemies and cities and 
                countries who submitted to him. Many times, he treated the people of other countries better than their previous own rulers 
                had done. Many of his generals were former enemies.

                In 1227, he was buried secretly in a grave in northern Mongolia so that his grave wouldn't be disturbed. There are many stories 
                and legends about his death including that everyone who attended his funeral were killed, a river was diverted to cover his grave, 
                and that trees were planted to hide his grave.
